From the beginning, people have tried to break out of divine boundaries, grab control of their own lives, and ignore what they knew to be right. Such is the case with the tower of Babel, a story that depicts the human desire to be independent of God. Pride can easily overtake us, as it did the tower builders: “Come, let’s build for ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves …” (Genesis 11:4). The ancient Greeks called this “hubris,” pride that offends the gods and leads to destruction. In his Letter to the Romans, Paul recognized the same pitfall: “They traded God’s truth for a lie, and they worshipped and served the creation instead of the creator” (Romans 1:25).</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">Rebellion includes disobedience (or transgression) and self-centeredness. We turn from God when we want to do things our way. The seven deadly sins listed in the Middle Ages—pride, greed, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, sloth—are called “source sins” because they are the fountainhead of sinning. But behind them is a willful, disobedient, self-centered rebellion. This rebellion is complete and universal:</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">“There is no righteous person, not even one.</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">There is no one who understands.</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal;tab-stops:.25in\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no one who looks for God”</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">(Romans 3:10-11; ref.
