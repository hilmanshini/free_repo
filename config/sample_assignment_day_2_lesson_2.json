It happens early and it happens often. Sin slithers its way through paradise. Sin lies in wait, ready to spring up and attack. Sin infiltrates the human heart. Sin corrupts the whole world and breeds violence. Sin drives people apart. And sin can also bring people together in pursuit of power. In every case, though, sin leads to chaos and broken relationships. </span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\"><br> Before I say more about the nature of sin, I need to acknowledge that many Christians avoid the topic of sin altogether, or only speak about sin in vague generalities. Yet exploring the first chapters of Genesis draws us into an honest—if uncomfortable—conversation about sin, because sin is all over the place. </span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">In Genesis 1-11 sin starts with individuals but then quickly moves throughout families and communities until the whole world is eventually under its influence. The primeval stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, and the tower of Babel tell a larger story of the constantly escalating effects of sin. These are deeply disturbing texts and often frustratingly ambiguous. </span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">The garden of Eden narrative in Genesis 2-3 leaves us with many questions: Why did God create such a crafty serpent? Why would God put a tree in the garden that would kill Adam and Eve? Why didn’t Eve die right away when she ate the fruit? Why is the tree called “the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?” And what does nakedness have to do with knowledge? There are no easy answers to any of these questions, and all of these questions have a bearing on our understanding of the nature of sin. But, in fact, the word “sin” does not appear at all in the story of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. </span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">This story presents a series of choices, which Adam and Eve always find some way to justify.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>The couple seems to know that God has forbidden them from eating from the tree. Yet they do so anyway. Though God has described the tree as dangerous and forbidden, Eve sees the tree differently because of the words of the serpent, who tells her she will become like God if she eats. </span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">The text gives us unique insight into her motivations. It reads, “She saw that [the tree] was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise” (Genesis 3:6). Her observations justify her choice to eat.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Adam eats, it would seem, simply because Eve did. Perhaps he thought, “Well, Eve seems to be okay, so it must be okay.” When confronted by God, Adam says that God gave him Eve, and Eve gave him the fruit of the tree. We really can’t tell whether this is Adam trying to give a justification after the fact or his actual motivation for eating the fruit in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">So much is unclear about Adam and Eve’s sin in this text. Yet the story is clearly concerned with showing how people justify their choices. </span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">The episode in the garden of Eden suggests that whatever our motivations or justifications for disobedience are, those choices have consequences, and what seems like a very small and even reasonable action, can have profound implications that resound for generations.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">In the story of Cain and Abel, the text of Genesis contains a uniquely direct reference to “sin.” Cain, the firstborn of Adam and Eve, is very angry that God shows “no regard” for his offerings. We don’t know why God didn’t like Cain’s offerings. The text just doesn’t say. But it does give us a fascinating conversation between Cain and God.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">Before Cain turns to violence, God asks him a series of questions: “Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted?” (Genesis 4:6-7). God’s questions then turn to a warning: “If you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door: its desire is for you, but you must master it” (Genesis 4:7).&nbsp;Cain can master it. Cain can do better.</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">But, of course, Cain doesn’t do better. He does worse than his parents. His parents made a choice to eat some fruit. Their relationship with God was changed. Their relationship to nature was changed. And their relationship with each other was changed. Adam and Eve’s sin resulted in strained relationships.</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">Cain’s sin, however, severs relationships permanently. He kills his own brother and then lies to God. His relationship to his brother is, of course, completely destroyed. His brother is dead. And his relationship with God is effectively over, as well. Cain leaves the presence of God and migrates “east of Eden in the Land of Nod.” While Cain survives and has a family, his sin becomes a family tradition. At the end of Genesis 4 we learn that Cain’s great-great-great-great grandson Lamech boasts that his own capacity for violence eclipses that of his murderous forefather.</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">In the flood story, we don’t find a direct reference to the word “sin.” Genesis 6:5 says that</span><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri;mso-hansi---invalid: Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;--invalid:red\"> </span><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri;mso-hansi---invalid: Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;--invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">the Lord saw “the wickedness of humankind, that it was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.” This description highlights both the pervasiveness and interiority of wickedness. The story of Adam and Eve showed that specific decisions, wrong actions, have negative consequences. The flood story, by contrast, doesn’t mention any specific actions, but instead claims that wickedness has taken root inside of everyone. Sin is no longer described as an external force that threatens to overwhelm someone, as we saw in Cain’s case,</span><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri;mso-hansi---invalid: Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;--invalid:red\"> </span><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri;mso-hansi---invalid: Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;--invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">but we see wickedness now</span><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid: Calibri;mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:red\"> </span><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">as fully assimilated into the human heart. Even more disturbing, the biblical flood account suggests that it is not only humans, but the whole world that has suffered “corruption” and is “filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11).</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">At the end of the flood story, God acknowledges that the wickedness of humanity hasn’t been solved by the deluge. After the water subsides, God’s assessment of humanity is strikingly similar to what it was before the flood. “The inclination of the human heart is evil from youth,” the text says (Genesis 8:21). But the post-diluvian world order provides God an opportunity to start the creative process over again, this time with Noah and his family as progenitors of the human family.</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">Genesis describes this new community as rapidly expanding. Noah’s family is indeed fruitful. And as they multiply, their ambitions grow. The story of the tower of Babel adds a further dimension to the picture of human sinfulness. So far in Genesis, we have seen sin breaking down relationships, destroying communities. But in this case, we see a community brought together in pursuit of their own power. In this episode, it appears that sin is of a political variety with distinctly theological implications. The text doesn’t use the words “sin,” “wickedness,” “evil,” “corruption,” or “violence.” But what seems to be the issue here is the community seeking their own glory, creating a monument to their own greatness. As with the other three stories, there are lots of unanswered questions about the nature of their sin. But the result of their actions is the same: confusion, disorder, and broken relationships, with the human family scattered throughout the world, no longer speaking one language.</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-ascii---invalid:Calibri; mso-hansi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi---invalid:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; --invalid:black;mso-theme--invalid:text1\">Amidst this confused and chaotic situation, with sin stubbornly persisting and humans spreading throughout the world, the focus of the narrative suddenly shifts in Genesis 12. A single figure emerges, one who will have a different kind of relationship with God than any who had gone before him. Abraham’s story begins with a promise from God: a promise of blessing for him and his family, and by extension a blessing for the families of the entire world, all those who have until this point been riven with sin in its myriad forms.</span></p><p></p>",
