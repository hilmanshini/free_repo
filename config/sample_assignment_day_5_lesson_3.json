From the well of self-centeredness comes the poisoned water of our personal and collective sins. Cain’s murder of Abel followed their parents’ disobedience. Things went from bad to worse as Lamech cried out proudly, “I killed a man for wounding me, a boy for striking me” (Genesis 4:23).</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">The sickness is widespread.

God did not abandon the woman and the man. God came to them, questioned them, but did not destroy them. Their punishment was a form of grace: The man would earn bread by sweat, yet work is one of life’s great blessings; the woman would bear children with pain, yet children are usually so welcome that the pangs of childbirth are soon forgotten.</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">Did God lie when God said they would die? Did the serpent tell the truth when he said they would not die? Both God and the serpent told their own truth. Life to God meant fulfillment, joy, a relationship of unblemished love. Life to the serpent meant eating and sleeping and going through the motions of living. When the woman and the man rebelled, something beautiful died. Innocence was destroyed. A relationship was broken. Pure love of God and one another was violated, mixed forever with guilt and spiritual separation. Cherubim and a flaming sword guard the garden of innocence. We can never go home again.</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">Yet God did not abandon the people. Even as God drove woman and man out of the land of innocence, God took the time and tenderness to make clothes for them and help them dress themselves (Genesis 3:21). Notice also that the “sign on Cain” (Genesis 4:15) was to protect him, not to persecute him as is commonly thought. The grace of God permeates the Bible. God’s mercy accompanies people even in their wickedness. That grace culminates in the cross of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\"><br></span></p><p></p>",
