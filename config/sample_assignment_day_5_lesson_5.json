It can  be anything you feel God has impressed upon your heart or mind. This  can be a prayer of praise, of thankfulness, of desired change, of  confession, of repentance, etc. You will always have an opportunity to  make any updates to your Personal Prayer before we close our group  meeting since you may have new thoughts as a result of our discussions.  You will be asked to pray your Personal Prayer aloud when we close our  group meeting. </span></p><p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt;mso-bidi---invalid:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin\"><br></span></p><p></p>",
