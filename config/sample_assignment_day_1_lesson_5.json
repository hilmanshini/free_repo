So, it was with humanity. When ancient Hebrews asked, “How did sin come into the world?” an elder would begin to tell the story of the first man and the first woman and the serpent. When the story was over, the people would nod their heads knowingly, for they then understood something about themselves and about the human race. </span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">Sin with its many manifestations runs through the Bible from beginning to end. We will study this theme in relation to freedom, relationship, temptation, rebellion, alienation, wickedness, and grace. Sin is not merely a topic. Sin is the human condition.</span></p><p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\"><br></span></p><p></p>",

This will—this divinely granted freedom—makes us different from rocks, plants, and animals. We have a will so that we can make choices. We are not totally determined by forces inside us or outside us. God wants children, not puppets.</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">When God said, “Don’t eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” (Genesis 2:17), God appealed to people’s freedom of choice.

If there is no God, there is no sin. We might violate social customs or stumble over the natural order, but sin is an affront to someone. We get out of step with our Creator. Sin changes our relationships with other people. Sin scrambles our inner self so that we experience feelings such as shame and guilt. The man and the woman disobeyed God, so they hid. They broke the innocent relationship of love and trust.</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><b><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">Temptation</span></b></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\">Some people say, “The devil made me do it.” That attitude sidesteps responsibility. Yet we are pushed and pulled by sinister forces. Human experience testifies to a “whisper in the ear.” The subtle serpent symbolizes an evil power that tempts us. Jesus was tempted (Matthew 4:1-11). Which one of us does not know the tug and nudge of temptation?</span></p><p style=\"--invalid:0in;--invalid:normal\"><span style=\"--invalid:12.0pt\"><br></span></p><p></p>",
